Users of this code will be able to change the inputs which allow to filter the option contract volume, open interest, and a bid ask spread. The algorithm will first attempt to use historical volatility as a forecast for future volatility only if there hasn't been earnings in the past month (Which skews volatility) and no earnings between today and the option expiry date. If this criteria is not met, the alpha (Average % Profit if the option trade was repeated) will be calculated using a blend of IV and HV. When the spread between them is higher than typical, this will put more emphasis on the one that has stayed more constant. Through my research, this volatility prediction model's average error for the following 30 days is ~3% closer to the actual 30 day volatility when compared to IV. It should be mentioned that I have not traded with this system, and therefore I do not know whether it is functionally profitable.
